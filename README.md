# Ready Player One - Virutal Accessories for virtually everyone!

## Description

Influenced by the book "Ready Player One", this little shop sells virtual items for the virtual world. 
Hop on, check out some items, throw them in a cart! Try to check out without an account and you'll have
to sign up! Once you do, you'll get an email confirmation. You can edit your profile, see your past orders and
even add an address(in fact you'll have to if you want to finish your order).You can even change your password, but it you will need your old one to do it.

If you're registered as an admin, you can do everything a user can do AND MORE! (like create, edit, update and delete items and see the entire order history.)
